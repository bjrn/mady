Even if you only use English, you may need MessageFormat for gender, pluralisation and even regionalisation (*regionalization*).\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\n* **Easy-to-use tool for parsing source files, adding locales, editing translations, comparing locales side-by-side, and compiling to (optionally minified) JavaScript modules**.\r\n* Use it also as a library: a no-frills translation function to run the compiled language modules.\r\n* **[React Intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl) interoperability**, both for message extraction and translation injection.\r\n* **MessageFormat messages**: while it does not solve all the problems in the huge field of i18n, MessageFormat is a much more powerful tool than the conventional gettext (IMHO).\r\n* **Full UNICODE support**: messages and translations can include any UNICODE character. In other words, you can now translate üëç (en) as üëè (es-ES) and then üíÉ (es-ES-andalusia)!\r\n* **BCP47 support**: fetch missing translations from parent/child languages, and even sibling languages (other regions) as a last resort.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install --save mady\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you use [React Intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl), make sure you also install the following packages so that Mady can parse your React Intl components:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-react-intl babel-core\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen add the following line to your `package.json` file:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"scripts\": {\r\n    \"translate\": \"mady\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor, if you want to store your locales in a specific folder (default: `<project root>/locales`):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"scripts\": {\r\n    \"translate\": \"mady --dir path/to/locales\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThere are two main parts in Mady: the web-based translation app and the translation function. The webapp is only needed during development (for the extraction, translation and management of messages and translations), whereas the translation function can be used in your own application, and hence in production as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The translation app\r\n\r\nAccess the translation app by running `npm run translate`. Mady will automatically launch in your default browser (default URL: http://localhost:8080). From the web application, you can:\r\n\r\n* Update the message database with new messages extracted from your source files\r\n* Configure your languages, source paths, file extensions, etc.\r\n* Translate your keys to the different supported languages\r\n* [Automatically] export translations to JS files and other formats, for use by the [translation function](#the-translation-function), React Intl and other integrations\r\n\r\nMessages in your source files might have the form: `_t('someContext_Once upon a time...')` (single or double quotes are supported), where `_t()` is the default name for the translation function (see below), `someContext` is some hint for the translator and `Once upon a time...` is your untranslated [MessageFormat](#messageformat) message.\r\n\r\nMady can also extract messages from React Intl components out of the box. Or you can specify your own regex patterns in the UI.\r\n\r\nConfiguration looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Mady config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guigrpa/mady/master/docs/02-config.png)\r\n\r\nYou can see the UI in English, Spanish and Catalan at the moment. Mady *eats her own dog food*.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The translation function\r\n\r\nUsing the translation function is similarly straightforward:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport _t from 'mady';\r\nimport locales from './locales/es';\r\n\r\n_t.setLocales(locales);\r\n\r\nconsole.log(_t('someContext_Once upon a time...'));\r\n// √ârase una vez...\r\nconsole.log(_t('someContext_Number of items: {NUM}', { NUM: 5 }));\r\n// N√∫mero de √≠tems: 5\r\nconsole.log(_t(\"someContext_{NUM, plural, one{1 hamburger} other{# hamburgers} }\", { NUM: 1 }));\r\n// 1 hamburguesa\r\nconsole.log(_t(\"someContext_{NUM, plural, one{1 hamburger} other{# hamburgers} }\", { NUM: 2 }));\r\n// 2 hamburguesas\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can set up locales beforehand and then activate one or the other. In case the requested variant is not available, its closest BCP47 parent is enabled:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport _t from 'mady';\r\nimport locales from './locales/es';\r\n\r\n_t.addLocales('es', locales);\r\nconst lang = _t.setLocales('es-US');\r\n// returns 'es', since we don't have the American Spanish variant\r\n\r\nconst lang = _t.setLocales('fr');\r\n// does nothing, since we have no French translations\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## BCP47 and translation fallbacks\r\n\r\nMady \"fills in the gaps\" when **building** translation modules (`{lang.js}`) and React Intl message bundles (`{lang}.reactIntl.json`). In other words, when you don't provide a translation for message X for a particular language (e.g. `es-ES`), it will look for suitable fallback translations in related languages:\r\n\r\n* Parent languages (e.g. `es`)\r\n* Sibling languages (e.g. `es-MX`)\r\n* Children languages (e.g. `es-ES-andalusia`)\r\n\r\nIf you use Mady's translation function and it cannot find a suitable translation, it will just take the message key (e.g. `someContext_Untranslated message`), remove the context prefix and use it as a last-resort fallback.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The locales folder\r\n\r\nYou can find the following files in the locales folder (`./locales` by default):\r\n\r\n* A configuration file: `config.json`\r\n* A message file: `keys.json`\r\n* A raw translation file per language, e.g. `fr.json` (this is the one you edit with the web application)\r\n* Several output files per language, depending on your configuration: a compiled translation module (`fr.js`), a message bundle for React Intl (e.g. `fr.reactIntl.json`), or a generic JSON file (e.g. `fr.out.json`). All of these files are generated automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n## MessageFormat\r\n\r\nMady uses the [messageformat.js](https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js) library by Alex Sexton, which \"supports and extends all parts of the **ICU MessageFormat** standard (see the [user guide](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages)), with the exception of the deprecated ChoiceFormat.\" IMHO, and while it does not solve all the problems in the huge field of i18n, it is a much more powerful tool than the conventional gettext.\r\n\r\nSome examples of MessageFormat messages are given above ([more here](https://messageformat.github.io/guide/)), but this does not even scratch the surface of what is enabled by this standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Internals\r\n\r\nMady is built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), and is fully server-side-rendered. It was built as a proof-of-concept for the latest web technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Changelog](https://github.com/guigrpa/mady/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why *Mady*?\r\n\r\nThis library is named after my cousin, a brilliant person with an extraordinary talent for languages. I thank her for teaching me English when I was a little child.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) [Guillermo Grau Panea](https://github.com/guigrpa) 2016\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
